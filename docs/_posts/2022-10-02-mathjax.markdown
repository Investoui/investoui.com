## MathJax

# Example 1 
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


# Example 2
{% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
{% endraw %}


## Example 3 

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]


## Example 4

The equation $ 3x^2 + 5x +1 = 0 $ has the solutions

$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2-12}}{6}
$$

# How to use MathJax with GitHub Pages, Jekyll and minima theme
Note: This was done using Jekyll 4.2.2 and Minima 2.5.1, and the exact procedure be different for other releases.

1. Add "markdown: kramdown" to _config.yml
2. Add the following files in the _includes folder. As theme data is not stored in your websites folder in current releases of minima, the files added "locally" will overwrite them.

_include/mathjax_support.html: 

        <script>
          MathJax = {
            tex: {
              inlineMath: [['$', '$']]
            }
          };
        </script>
        <script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
          src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
        </script>


Assuming you have installed minima on you local computer, find the location of your minima theme:<br>
bundle info --path minima

Find the head.html, and copy it to your site folder under _includes
/home/user/gems/gems/minima-2.5.1/_includes/head.html
Target: _includes/head.html

In the <head> section, add the following:
        {% if page.use_math %}
        {% include mathjax_support.html %}
        {% endif %}

To enable MathJax in a post, enable it like this:
use_math: true
