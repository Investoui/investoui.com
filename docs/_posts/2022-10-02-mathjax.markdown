# Example 1 
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


# Example 2
{% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
{% endraw %}


## Example 3 

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]


## Example 4

The equation $3x^2 + 5x +1 = 0$ has the solutions

$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2-12}}{6}
$$
