> __Linear regression__ aims to find the best fit straight line between two variables. It is a linear model aiming, i.e. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (x) and the output variable (y). It means y can be expressed as a linear expression of the variable x.

$$
X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_0 \\x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n 
\end{bmatrix}
\in R^{n+1}
$$
